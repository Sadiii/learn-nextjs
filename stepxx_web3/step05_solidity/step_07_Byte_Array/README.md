# Byte Array

A byte array is used to represent a sequence of bytes of arbitrary length. There are two types of byte arrays: fixed-length and dynamic-length.

It store hexadecimal values in an array. 


## Fixed Length Byte Array

- A fixed-length byte array has a predetermined length that is set at the time of declaration and cannot be changed. 
- The length of a fixed-length byte array is specified using the syntax "bytesN", where N is the number of bytes in the array, i.e byte2, byte3, byte8.
- It's immutable. We can't perform push and pop function on fixed length byte array.
