# Loops

Solidity supports several types of loops that are commonly used in programming languages.


## Types:


- **For Loop:** is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration.
- **while loop:** is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true
- **do-while loop:** is similar to the while loop, except that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.
