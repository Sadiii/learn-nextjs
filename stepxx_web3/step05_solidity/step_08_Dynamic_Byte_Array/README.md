# Byte Array

A byte array is used to represent a sequence of bytes of arbitrary length. There are two types of byte arrays: fixed-length and dynamic-length.

It store hexadecimal values in an array. Overall, byte arrays are useful for working with binary data, such as cryptographic keys or encoded data.


## Dynamic-length Byte array:


- A dynamic-length byte array has a length that can be changed at runtime. 
- The length of a dynamic-length byte array is not specified in the declaration.
- Dynamic-length byte arrays are stored in memory.
- Their length can be changed using the "push" and "pop" functions.
