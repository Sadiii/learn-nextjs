# Dynamic Array

A dynamic array has a length that can be changed at runtime. The elements of a dynamic array are stored sequentially in memory, but the location of the array data in memory can change if the length of the array changes.
## Features

- Dynamic arrays are useful when you don't know the exact number of elements you need to store.
- It's useful when you want to add or remove elements from the array at runtime.
- It's also worth noting that dynamic arrays are more expensive to use than fixed-size arrays because Solidity needs to keep track of the array length and the location of the array data in memory.
