# Fixed Array

A fixed-size array has a fixed length that is set at the time of declaration and cannot be changed. Elements of a fixed-size array are stored sequentially in memory.
## Features

- Fixed-size arrays are useful when you know the exact number of elements you need to store and want to ensure that the array size does not change.
- Fixed size arrays are cheaper as compare to Dynamic sized array.
- push and pop function will not work in fixed size array.
