# Struct

Structs are a way to define custom data types in Solidity. They can be used to group related data types together and create more complex data structures. In addition to the basic data types like uint, bool, and string, structs can also include arrays, other structs, and mappings.
## Features:

- Structure can be build inside or outside the contract.
- Structure is combination of multiple datatypes thatâ€™s why we call it complex type. 
- Structs can also be used to define the data schema for smart contracts.
- Similar to type object in typescripts.
