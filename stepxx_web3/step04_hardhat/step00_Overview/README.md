# Overview Hardhat

Here is our introduction to Ethereum contracts and dApp creation for beginners.

Hardhat is an open-source development environment for building and testing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a suite of tools and plugins that make it easier for developers to write, deploy, and test their smart contracts.
## Features:


- Hardhat comes with a built-in **local blockchain** network that developers can use to test their smart contracts before deploying them to the Ethereum mainnet.
- Hardhat provides a **testing framework** that allows developers to write and run tests for their smart contracts, ensuring that they work as expected.
- Hardhat includes a **Solidity compiler** that can be used to compile smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language.
- Hardhat includes a **debugger** that can be used to step through smart contract code and identify any issues or bugs.
- Hardhat has a **plugin architecture** that allows developers to extend its functionality with custom plugins.


## Learning Outlines:

- Setting up your Node.js environment for Ethereum development
- Creating and configuring a Hardhat project
- The basics of a Solidity smart contract that implements a token
- Writing automated tests for your contract using Hardhat
- Debugging Solidity with console.log() using Hardhat Network
- Deploying your contract to Hardhat Network and Ethereum testnets
